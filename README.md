# springboot-multi-module-architecture
The porject containe springboot multi-module architecture demo. As we all know creating Springboot project through springboot-initializer follows traditional structure. But what if we are working on a big module in some scenerios that traditional structure would end up with a lot of fuzzyness and redundent code. Here the multimodule approach comes into picture. In the module I have seperated the whole project into 4 modules( repository, service, controller, domain ) under a parent module.
